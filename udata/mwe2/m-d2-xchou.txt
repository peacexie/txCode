
<b>经典诗歌英译《乡愁》</b>

乡愁
余光中

小时侯
乡愁是一枚小小的邮票
我在这头
母亲在那头

长大后
乡愁是一张窄窄的船票
我在这头
新娘在那头

后来呵
乡愁是一方矮矮的坟墓
我在外头
母亲呵在里头

而现在
乡愁是一湾浅浅的海峡
我在这头
大陆在那头

Nostalgia
by Yu Guangzhong
tr Rhapsodia（晚枫）

When I was a boy
Nostalgia was a tiny stamp
I was at this end
My mother at that

When I grew up
Nostalgia was a slim steamer ticket
I was at this end
My bride at that

Years later
Nostalgia was a squatty tomb
I was out this side
My mother was in that

And now
Nostalgia is a shallow strait
I am at this shore
Mainland is at that
