
<b>爱情测试：看看你们的爱情是哪种？</b>

Have I fallen in love? Is this love real? Maybe I like this person? I don’t know my own feelings… Everyone has had these worries about love at least once. If s/he is already married or is a type completely opposite to yours, you may feel crazy and don’t want to admit to your feelings. But aren’t there times when you realised “love” through your unconscious attitude towards someone or something that he said that keeps running in your head?
我是不是坠入了爱河？这就是所谓的爱情吗？我是不是喜欢上了这个人？真搞不懂我这是怎么了……遇到爱情，每个人都经历过这样的纠结。要是碰上对方已经结婚，或完全不是预想的类型，你会觉得自己肯定疯了，无论如何也不愿承认自己有这种感情。可你潜意识里还是会隐隐察觉到对某人的“爱意”，或在脑子里不自觉地回想他说过的话吧？
