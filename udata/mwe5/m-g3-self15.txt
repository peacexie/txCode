
<b>15种方式，善待你自己吧！</b>

I love myself. That sounds a bit silly (and I doubt anyone would ever say it out loud), but self-love isn’t reserved for the egomaniacs of the world. Finding the confidence to succeed (or even the courage to start) is very difficult if you don’t love yourself. If you’re ready to swoon your hot self, keep on reading.
“我爱自己。”——听上去真滑稽，估计很少有人会大声喊出来吧？不过，自爱并不一定就是自大狂。如果不爱自己，又怎能有勇气迈开第一步或有信心赢得成功呢？倘若你已决定好好爱自己，那就继续往下读吧。

1. Stop Beating Yourself Up
停止苦逼

Would you say the things you think about yourself to another person? If not, you owe yourself an apology. How could you love a person who believes such nasty things about you? Even if you did mess up, get over it. Big goof that’s mostly irrelevant? Laugh at it. Serious mistake that had repercussions? Learn from it. The important thing is to drop your baggage and move on.
你会不会把内心对自己的那些看法用来评价另外一个人？如果不会，那你还欠自己一个道歉。你怎会爱上听信有关你的坏话的人呢？就算你确实搞砸过，那也是过去了。难得犯了糊涂？一笑而过吧。犯了后果严重的错误？那就吸取教训。重要的是抛开包袱，继续前行。

2. Think Positive
积极思考

Focus on your strengths (instead of your weaknesses). Leap out of bed (don’t crawl out of it). Look at every day as a new opportunity (not the same old story).
不要老盯着缺点，而应多想想优点。要一跃而起，不可拖拉磨叽。不要认为日无新事，其实每天都是新机遇。

3. Be Thankful
充满感恩

Be aware of all the things you should be thankful for. Make note of the people, places, things and activities that bring you the most joy. If you slow down, you’ll realize you have an awful lot to be thankful for.
用心留意所有值得感恩的事情。记下那些给自己带来快乐的人和事。只要放慢脚步，你一定会发现值得感恩的事情太多太多。

4. Learn and Grow
学习并成长

Developing your knowledge and skills will help you develop a healthy swagger and confidence that you can do anything.
扩充知识及磨练技能可让你健全而充满自信，要相信自己可以做好任何事情。
