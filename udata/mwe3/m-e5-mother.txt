
<b>M-O-T-H-E-R 我爱你</b>

mother
M-O-T-H-E-R 
“M” is for the million things she gave me, 
“O” means only that she is growing old, 
“T” is for the tears she shed to save me, 
“H” is for her heart of purest gold, 
“E” is for her eyes,with love-light shining, 
“R” means right,and right she will always be. 
Put them all together, 
they spell “MOTHER”, 
A word that means the world to me. 
---Howard  Johnson（c.1915） 

译文： 
M代表着母亲给予了我们一切， 
O意味着与此同时她正在衰老， 
T象征着她为了拯救我们流的泪， 
H表明了她最无私最伟大的心灵， 
E是她充满着爱万分温柔的眼神， 
R说明着正确，并且代表着她永恒的真理。 
把他们和在一起， 便是母亲， 
一个代表着最无私最伟大的给予了我所有全部的词。
