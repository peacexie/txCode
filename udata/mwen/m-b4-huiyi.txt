Love one another and you will be happy. It’s simple, yet difficult.
彼此相爱就是幸福。如此简单，如此难。

If you really love her, you wouldn’t be afraid to tell the whole world.
如果真的爱，将不会害怕昭告天下。

If only you knew how much I think of you.
假如你知道我有多想念你那该多好。

The wind blows as usual. Flowers blooms as usual. The sun rises from the east as before. But something has changed.
风还是一样地吹，花还是一样地开，太阳还是一样地升起，可是有些事情已经变得不一样了。

People can change. They just don’t because it’s easier not to. We’re always waiting for our life to begin. All we have is now. Don’t run from this.
人可以改变，墨守陈规却更容易，所以总巴望着生活重新开始，可我们拥有的是现在，别逃避。

When you are beside me, every second is wonderfull.
有你在身边，每一秒都是美妙的。

Everything happens just in the right moment.
一切已发生的都是最好的安排。

I’m the girl that always has her phone in her hands, headphones in her ears and that one guy on her mind.
我就是那种女孩：手机不离手，耳机不离耳，心上人始终在心头。

You heard a familiar lyric and you are suddenly thinking about the one who used to say he will protect you but now he is gone.
听到一句熟悉的歌词，想起某个曾经说要守护你，现在却不在身边的人。

Never place your happiness in someone else’s hands, because once they’re gone, so is your happiness.
不要把自己的幸福都寄托在别人身上，因为他们一旦离开，你的幸福也会没了踪影。

Wherever love is, I want to be, I will follow it as surely as the land-locked salmon finds the sea.
我想去任何一个充满爱的地方，我要像那些回游的鲑鱼一样坚定，寻找爱的踪迹。
