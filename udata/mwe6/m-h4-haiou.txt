
<b>海鸥与上帝</b>

A father was at the beach with his children when the four-year-old son ran up to him, grabbed his hand, and led him to the shore, where a seagull lay dead in the sand.
 
“Daddy, what happened to him?” the son asked.
 
“He died and went to Heaven,” the dad replied.
 
The boy thought a moment and then said, “Did God throw him back down?”
 
一位父亲和他4岁的儿子在沙滩上，突然儿子跑向他，抓着他的手冲向岸边，那里有一只死海鸥躺在沙滩上。
 
“爸爸，它发生了什么事？”儿子问。
 
“他死了，去了天堂，”父亲回答。
 
男孩想了一会儿，然后说，“那是上帝把它扔下来的吗？”
