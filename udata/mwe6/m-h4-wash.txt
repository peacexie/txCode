Wash it again
再洗一遍
 
Mother had decided to trim her household budget wherever possible, so instead of having a dress drycleaned she washed it by hand. Proud of her savings, she boasted to my father, “Just think, Fred, we are five dollars richer because I washed this dress by hand.”
“Good,” my dad quickly replied. “Wash it again!”
妈妈决定尽可能削减家庭预算，所以不再把衣服送去干洗而是手洗。骄傲于自己的成绩，母亲向父亲吹嘘道，“试想一下，弗雷德，因为我洗这件衣服咱们多了5块钱。”
“好，”我爸很快回答说，“那再洗一遍吧！”
